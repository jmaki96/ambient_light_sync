"""The lightning modules provide an interface to any of the lower-level device specific modules for interacting with
and programming lights. At the root level, base classes should be defined to provide standard interfaces for any
lighting tool.

NOTE: The term "base classes" is used here, which implies only an object oriented model
but over the course of the project - different schemes may be implemented. For example, composition may be favored over
direction inheritance.
